Run AnalysisProject.py in order to generate plots sequencially. Save them manually and close the windows (the last plot generated will be the CMD plot with Padova isochrones on it). The script assumes that the Padova isochrones text files, the Python script itself and the FIT files (Darks, Biases, Flat fields and cluster images in i' and r' filters) are all in the same directory. The dataset used for generating the article's data is available at:
